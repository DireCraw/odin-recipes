    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3><p>Chili has been a staple of Texas cuisine since the days when cowboys drove herds of cattle across the country.  As the state food of Texas, it has become a symbol of sorts for comfort food in the Lone Star State</p>
    <p>My own version of Chipotle Chili includes a blend of 5 different peppers and can be made with or without beans, depending on your personal preferences.</p></h3>
