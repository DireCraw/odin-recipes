            <h2>Description</h2>    
            <h3><p>Vindaloo is a traditional Goan curry dish that is served worlwide.  It is often a very spicy dish, bringing the heat of many of it's ingredients into a delicious curry that excited the taste buds.</p>
            <p>The origin of this dish comes from Portuguese <em>carne de vinha d/alhos</em> in which meat was marinated in vinegar and garlic.  The British Indian version tweaked this recipe to include fresh ginger, sugar, and other spices, which are then cooked with even more spices.</p></h3>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3><ol>
                <li>Add paste ingredients to blender and blend until smooth</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add meat along with blended vindaloo paste, 2 tsp salt (more or less to taste) and 2 tsp sugar. Note: if you plan to cook on a stovetop, use meat tenderizer if you like.</li>
                <li>Combine well, cover, and let marinate overnight in the fridge.  Meat should marinate for a minimum of 2 hours, but keep in mind the longer it marinates, the more tender and delicious the meat will be.</li>
                <li>To start with, place the steel insert switch on the IP and press 'Sauté'. Once the screens displays 'Hot', heat 5 tablespoons vegetable oil. Then, add 1½ cups chopped onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes or until soft and pink.</li>
                <li>Add marinated meat and sauté for 4-5 minutes.  Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li>If anything sticks during this step, add some water to deglaze the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Add up to 1 cup water depending on the consistency you would like.  Add 1 sprig of curry leaves (if desiered) and stir.</li>
                <li>Cover the lid and seal the pot with valve in sealing position. Press 'Manual' or 'Pressure Cook' and set the timer to 20 minutes on 'High'. Once the cooking cycle is complete, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes. Then, do the quick release.</li>
                <li>Open the pot, check for the salt and add more if needed, stir. If you want thicker curry, then switch on the 'sauté' and simmer for 3-4 minutes until it reaches desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Let it rest for 5 minutes. Bright fiery mutton vindaloo is ready to serve. Dish out, garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.</li>
            </ol></h3>
